# Random-Binary-Tree-Printer-in-ASCII


This piece of codes will randomly generate a randomize binary tree in ASCII form with given amount of nodes by the user.


Here are the images of what you can expect when running this program:

*Please do not input a large number of nodes, although the algorithm I made is very optimized in terms of time complexity, the time it takes to print something out onto the screen will prolong the runtime by a significant amount! (also, your screen will not have enough space to print a binary tree with a gigantic amount of nodes)*
